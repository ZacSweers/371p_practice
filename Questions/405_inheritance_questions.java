/**
 * 1. Does this line compile? Why or why not?
 * 		final ArrayList<Shape> x = new ArrayList<Circle>(10);
 *
 * 2. Consider the following array:
 * 		final Shape[]  a = {new Shape(2, 3), new Circle(2, 3, 4)};
 *
 * 	  Which oject's area() would a[0].area() and a[1].area() call, respectively?
 * 	  What about in C++?
 *
 * 3. What does the "final" keyword mean in a method? What's the C++ equivelant?
 *
 * 4. Why do Shape and Circle's equals() methods require taking in an Object?
 *
 * 		public boolean equals (Object rhs) {...}
 *
 * 5. Using that same snippet of code, how would you call Shape's equals() method from Circle's equals() method?
