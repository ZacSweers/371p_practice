1.
	*this of the object, by reference

2.
	a copy of _p

3.
	the get() function

4.
	Used to track the number of instances of an Object there are. Useful in helping track memory leaks and sanity checks

5.
	pointer get () {
        if (!unique()) {
            --_p->_c;
            _p = new count(_p->_q->clone());}
        return _p->_q;}

6.
	 Handle (const Handle& that) {
        if (!that._p)
            _p = 0;
        else {
            _p = that._p;
            ++_p->_c;}}

7. 
	The object pointer is now kept in the "count" struct, which in turn keeps a reference count as well. The 
	handle object itself contains just a pointer to a "count" struct

8.
	It doesn't change the API of Handle1 that we used before, but makes it more useful. Illustrates good OOP design
	where a package/class can be changed without requiring the programmer to change how the dependent classes/packages 
	are implemented. AKA the API stays the same.

9. 
	It implements a shared pointer to use for reference counting via storing an object into an internal container and keeping track of it.
	we use unique() and use_count() to check uniqueness and the RC of the object stored

10.
	boost::shared_ptr<AbstractShape> x(new Circle(2, 3, 4));
